Advent of Code Day 1 Solution 1: 

This is my solution using sketchup for the day 1 part one challenge on http://adventofcode.com/2016



To use this sample code: 

1. Launch Sketchup

2. Open Ruby Console (Window -> Ruby Console) 

3. Paste in the code found in day1_1.rb

4. Run `print_city(your_array)`

5. The last set of numbers output are the coords to the last position!
